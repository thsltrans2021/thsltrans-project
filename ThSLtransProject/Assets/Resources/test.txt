            Once upon a time, the mice held a meeting. They wanted to figure out what to do about their most dreaded enemy, the cat. Several mice spoke, proposing a variety of solutions. But then a very young mouse stood up and announced that he had a plan.

“The cat is so very dangerous,” said the young mouse, “because she’s sly and sneaky. She tiptoes along on little padded paws. Why, we never even hear her coming!”

The assembled mice nodded in agreement. 

“My suggestion,” continued the young mouse, “is that we tie a bell around the cat’s neck. That way we could hear her trying to sneak up. We’d always have time to run and hide.” 

The meeting of mice burst into applause. This was a wonderful idea, it was generally agreed. But then an old mouse stood up slowly. He had to strain to be heard above all the mouse chatter. 

“The young mouse’s idea sounds good,” the old mouse said. “But now we have a brand-new problem. Who will hang the bell on the cat?”
